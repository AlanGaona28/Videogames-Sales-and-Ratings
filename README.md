# Videogames Sales and Ratings

The objective of the project was to analyse the videogame sales and ratings database to create a recommendation for the sales and marketing teams of a company, creating a tailored strategy according to the findings. This will be achieved by examining several features of the database, such as sales across different regions, customer and critic reviews, genre, and platform of the video games. The Video Game Sales and Ratings dataset from Kaggle was used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings.

The project used both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to obtain insights from the datasets, using Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks to predict sales, and a K-means algorithm to cluster different characteristics.
